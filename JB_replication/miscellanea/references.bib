	abstract = {Urban centers in Latin American often face high levels of air pollution as a result of economic and industrial growth. Decisions with regard to industry, transportation, and development will affect air pollution and health both in the short term and in the far future through climate change. We investigated the pollution health consequences of modest changes in fossil fuel use for three case study cities in Latin American: Mexico City, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and São Paulo, Brazil. Annual levels of ozone and particulate matter were estimated from 2000 to 2020 for two emissions scenarios: (1) business-as-usual based on current emissions patterns and regulatory trends and (2) a control policy aimed at lowering air pollution emissions. The resulting air pollution levels were linked to health endpoints through concentration–response functions derived from epidemiological studies, using local studies where available. Results indicate that the air pollution control policy would have vast health benefits for each of the three cities, averting numerous adverse health outcomes including over 156,000 deaths, 4 million asthma attacks, 300,000 children's medical visits, and almost 48,000 cases of chronic bronchitis in the three cities over the 20-year period. The economic value of the avoided health impacts is roughly \$21 to \$165 billion ({US}). Sensitivity analysis shows that the control policy yields significant health and economic benefits even with relaxed assumptions with regard to population growth, pollutant concentrations for the control policy, concentration–response functions, and economic value of health outcomes. This research demonstrates the health and economic burden from air pollution in Latin American urban centers and the magnitude of health benefits from control policies.},

These somewhat counterintuitive findings are likely to stem from the limited availability of ground-based air pollution data used in {GH} and the absence of critical meteorological confounders. I leverage recent advances in satellite technology and {GH}’s methodology to test the sensitivity of their findings to revised air pollution outcomes, an extended number of observations, and meteorological controls. Despite striking differences between the two datasets, reexamination using satellite-based data confirms the conclusions drawn from {GH}’s data. The effects of the policies are, however, substantially weaker. The paper urges further research on the effectiveness of environmental regulations in developing countries and the use of satellite imagery in the examination of this important question.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered {DiD} setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

We make four novel points about identification and estimation of causal effects in this setting and show their practical relevance. First, we show that in the presence of unit and time fixed effects, it is impossible to identify the linear component of the path of pre-trends and dynamic treatment effects. Second, we propose graphical and statistical tests for pre-trends. Third, we consider commonly-used “static” regressions, with a treatment dummy instead of a full set of leads and lags around the treatment event, and we show that {OLS} does not recover a reasonable weighted average of the treatment effects: long-run effects are weighted negatively, and we introduce different estimators robust to this issue. Fourth, we show that equivalent problems of under-identification and negative weighting arise in difference-in-differences settings when the control group is allowed to be on a different time trend or in the presence of unit-specific time trends.},

To do so, we construct an ample panel dataset on the prevalence of corrupt practices by local politicians, which is employed to test the possible impact of partisan alignment in three consecutive joint municipal and regional elections. Findings show aligned municipalities to be more corrupt than non-aligned ones, an effect that is further associated with absolute majorities at both levels of government and higher capital transfers. By contrast, we also show that “throwing the rascals out” could be an effective strategy for curbing the corrupt practices of aligned municipalities. This indicates that the democratic political process may be effective in corruption control if agreements can be reached to remove corrupt politicians or parties from power.},

					El artículo presenta resultados de una investigación en torno al acoso y la violencia política hacia las presidentas municipales en México. A través de testimonios y experiencias de las presidentas municipales, recabados entre 1996 y 2009, dibuja los antecedentes de los fenómenos mencionados, en el contexto de una cultura política autoritaria, clientelar y machista. Así, se presenta un panorama de la violencia política dirigida a los alcaldes y otros funcionariosmunicipales, que se desata a partir de la llamada guerra contra el narcotráfico (política adoptada por el Estado mexicano en 2006). Esta situación generó denuncias y propuestas de los partidos políticos y las asociaciones municipalistas, así como algunas manifestaciones de preocupación de algunos diputados y senadores. La violencia generalizada alcanza dimensiones críticas, incluyendo la dirigida hacia las mujeres en diversos espacios sociales. En enero de 2016, se llegó a un punto de quiebre con el asesinato de Gisela Mota Ocampo, alcaldesa de Temixco, Morelos, primera presidenta municipal en funciones asesinada por un comando armado. El artículo sintetiza los resultados de un seguimiento hemerográfico, presentando algunos de los casos más representativos de acoso y violencia política hacia las presidentas municipales en nuestro país de 2010 a 2016, finalizando con el caso de Gisela Mota Ocampo.

The number of Democratic voters will be positively correlated with federal outlays, even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. The degree to which a program will be skewed to Democrats will be a function of the amount of variation in program benefits across districts, whether the program is administered by formula, and the extent of one-party control when the program is initiated. Regression analysis of district-level data on election outcomes and federal assistance programs for the period 1984-90. The number of Democratic voters is an important predictor of the amount of federal dollars flowing to a district. Programs with a greater amount of variation across districts are more heavily skewed to Democrats, as are programs administered by formula. Programs initiated in the latter half of the 1970s, a time of solid Democratic control, exhibit the greatest bias towards Democrats; programs started in the Reagan era show no such bias. Our results are consistent with a model in which parties in the United States play an important, but limited role in determining the distribution of federal dollars: given enough time, parties can target types of voters, but they cannot easily target specific districts.},

Individualistic economic agents will optimize in the manner of John Nash, while cooperative ones do so in the manner of Immanuel Kant. I argue that Kantian optimization decentralizes resource allocation in ways that separate issues of equity (income distribution) from efficiency.

Building on the success of the first edition, Understanding Regulation, Second Edition provides the reader with an introduction to key debates and discussions in the field of regulation from a number of disciplinary perspectives, looking towards law, conomics, business, political science, sociology, and social administration. The book has been extensively revised and updated to take into account the significant developments and events of the past decade. Containing several new chapters, it has been completely restructured into seven parts, covering: the fundamental issues regarding regulation; different types of regulatory strategies; rules and enforcement; quality and evaluation; regulation at different levels of government; network issues; and concluding thoughts. Drawing on cross-sectoral and cross-national examples, this book reviews the central questions of regulation, and reflects upon those contentious issues that affect the design and operation of regulatory institutions. Amongst other topics, it discusses 'better regulation', enforcement, self-regulation, risk regulation, cost-benefit analysis, and more utility regulation-oriented topics, such as price-setting. It will be an essential resource for academics, researchers, and graduates across the social sciences studying regulation.},

The results indicate that positive spillovers exist in each period due to the connectivity characteristic of transport infrastructure at the national level. At the regional level, transport infrastructure spillover effects vary considerably over time among China’s four macro-regions: the eastern region enjoyed positive spillovers all the time; the northeastern region had no significant spillover effects in 1978–1990, negative spillovers in 1991–2000, and positive spillovers in 2001–2009; the central region had negative spillovers for the three sub-periods; for the western region, negative spillovers can be observed after the 1990s.

This paper employs a spatial Durbin model ({SDM}) to investigate the impacts of both air pollution and its spatial spillover effect on public health in 116 cities of China over 2006–2012. We use the survey data of lung cancer mortality and respiratory diseases mortality from 161 sites of mortality censoring spots in China to measure public health and use the statistical data of industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide and soot from the corresponding cities to measure air pollution. Compared with the existing studies, from the perspective of the scale and scope of dataset, our dataset can be regarded as a big data sample in the fields of environmental and health economics. We estimate the direct and indirect effects of air pollution to distinguish the local and neighbors' impacts of air pollution on the mortalities caused by the two diseases. The empirical results provide the evidence for the adverse impacts of air pollution and its spatial spillover effect on public health. On average, an increase of ten thousand tonnes in industrial sulfur dioxide emissions in certain city will lead to an increase of 0.035 and 0.03 per ten thousand persons in local mortalities from lung cancer and respiratory diseases, respectively, and a total increase of 0.217 and 1.543 per ten thousand persons in the mortalities of all its neighbors from lung cancer and respiratory diseases, respectively. On an annual average, due to the air pollution, more than 200 billion {RMB} are spent on the medical treatment for curing health damages, and approximate hundred thousand lives were taken away.},

In one view, voters can affect candidates' policy choices: competition for votes induces politicians to move toward the center. In this view, elections have the effect of bringing about some degree of policy compromise. In the alternative view, voters merely elect policies: politicians cannot make credible promises to moderate their policies, and elections are merely a means to decide which one of two opposing policy views will be implemented. We assess which of these contrasting perspectives is more empirically relevant for the U. S. House. Focusing on elections decided by a narrow margin allows us to generate quasi-experimental estimates of the impact of a “randomized” change in electoral strength on subsequent representatives' roll-call voting records. We find that voters merely elect policies: the degree of electoral strength has no effect on a legislator's voting behavior. For example, a large exogenous increase in electoral strength for the Democratic party in a district does not result in shifting both parties' nominees to the left. Politicians' inability to credibly commit to a compromise appears to dominate any competition-induced convergence in policy.},

Panel data on water pollution in Brazilian rivers coupled with county splits that change the locations of borders allow us to identify the spatial patterns of pollution as rivers approach and cross borders, controlling for fixed effects and trends specific to each location. The theory of externalities predicts that pollution should increase at an increasing rate as the river approaches the downstream exit border, that there should be a structural break in the slope of the pollution function at the border, and that a larger number of managing jurisdictions should exacerbate pollution externalities. We find support for all four predictions in the data. Satellite data on growth in night-time lights along rivers show that local authorities allow more settlements to develop close to rivers in the downstream portions of counties, which is the likely underlying mechanism. The border effects on pollution are not as pronounced when the cost of inter-jurisdictional coordination is lower.},

	shorttitle = {Assessing side-payment and cost-sharing patterns in international water agreements},
	abstract = {To a large degree, conflicts over transboundary freshwater resources arise because property rights have not been clearly defined. International water law provides only hints and suggestions as to how states should resolve their water disputes, since legal principles and clauses are ambiguous and contradictory. But conflict often creates a need for cooperation, which is achieved by means of negotiations, and the specific outcome of negotiations is almost always codified in an international treaty. This article considers bilateral water agreements for rivers with particular geographical configurations and aims to answer a fundamental question: how and why do bilateral treaties vary in their design? Further, it examines international freshwater treaties to deduce the nature of treaty remedies, particularly the side-payment and cost-sharing arrangements, used for resolving conflict over rivers shared by two countries. The theory and testable hypotheses consider geography and economics in order to explore treaty design. In essence, the ‘willingness to pay’ of one of the states reflects on the property rights solution and can be explained by geography and economics. Three geographical configurations are investigated here. The findings affirm that side-payments frequently occur to offset an asymmetric geographical relationship between upstream and downstream states, and are commonly regarded as an appropriate instrumentality for solving a property rights dispute. Side-payments are non-existent when the geographic relationship among the riparians is symmetric and costs for the joint project are most always equally shared. As expected, in this latter case, the geography of the river acts as a focal point for equal participation. When economic differences are taken into account, especially when the upstream state is richer, the side-payment outcome is reversed. As expected, richer states internalize the costs of taking action in favor of poorer downstream states. When the geographical relationship between the riparians is of a symmetrical nature, while the economic relationship between the states is of an asymmetrical nature, the richer state often assumes the bulk of the cost burden. In this way, it provides a side-payment to the poorer state. Such patterns reveal how property rights disputes over issues such as water quantity, hydropower, pollution abatement, and flood control have been concluded. They suggest how ongoing disputes may be resolved.},

	abstract = {At political boundaries, local leaders have weak incentives to reduce polluting activity because the social costs are borne by downstream neighbors. This paper exploits a natural experiment set in China in which the central government changed the local political promotion criteria and thus incentivized local officials to reduce border pollution along specific criteria. We document evidence of pollution progress with respect to targeted criteria at province boundaries. Heavy metal pollutants, not targeted by the central government, have not decreased in concentration after the regime shift. Using data on the economic geography of key industrial water polluters, we explore possible mechanisms. ({JEL} D72, O13, O18, P25, P28, Q25, Q53)},

	abstract = {The governance of water is of increasing concern to policy makers. Several property rights systems, which allow for control of water by the individual, community, or state have been advocated, but no approach has been uniformly successful in resolving problems arising from competing uses. Recently, in an attempt to resolve challenges experienced under state control, a number of judicial rulings and statutes have used the ‘Rights of Nature’ approach to grant rivers legal rights around the world. Here we put forward the proposition that granting legal rights to rivers can be viewed as creating a new property rights system that we term resource self-determination. We test this model of resource self-determination against two cases where rivers have been granted legal rights in New Zealand and India to explicate how resource self-determination has been defined in each case. Although we find that the New Zealand decision results in a more clearly defined property rights system than occurs in India, in neither context are the new bundle of rights complete. We conclude that in the cases examined, unless the definitional shortfalls are addressed, granting legal rights to rivers is unlikely to resolve the long-standing competing use problems affecting these rivers.},

However, interventions providing toilets in rural areas have not substantially improved health, likely because of incomplete coverage and low usage. This paper estimates the impact of an integrated water and sanitation improvement program in rural India that provided household-level water connections, latrines, and bathing facilities to all households in approximately 100 villages. The estimates suggest that the intervention was effective, reducing treated diarrhea episodes by 30-50\%. These results are evident in the short term and persist for 5 years or more. The annual cost is approximately {US}\$60 per household.},

Meta-analyzing eighty-four studies to synthesize findings, this article confirms conventional wisdom among students of judicial behavior that party is a dependable yardstick for ideology: Democratic judges are more liberal on the bench than Republican judges. Two methodological characteristics moderate study results—statistical technique and researchers' use of only nonunanimous appellate decisions. The weighted-mean-product-moment effect size of party, regardless of court or subject matter, and corrected for moderator effects, is +.615, explaining 38 percent of the variance of judicial ideology. Further, party is a stronger attitudinal force in federal courts, attributable for almost half of the variance, than in state tribunals.},

The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

	abstract = {Este trabajo destaca la importancia que la organización informal tiene en el funcionamiento de los partidos en América Latina. Las organizaciones de partidos latinoamericanos cuentan con mecanismos, procedimientos y reglas no escritos, redes personales -de carácter autónomo- y recursos no estrictamente del partido que ayudan a éstos a alcanzar sus diversas metas y tener una conexión fuerte con el electorado. El universo no es uniforme y los partidos presentan diferencias significativas en cuanto al tipo de organización y su nivel de institucionalización Este artículo esboza las características de un nuevo tipo de partido (los partidos informales de masas), que mantienen una poderosa infraestructura de base, extensos vínculos con la clase baja o trabajadora y una amplia membresía (o mejor dicho, una selectiva membresía de brokers) y que, al mismo tiempo, las subunidades son autoorganizadas, carecen de una estructura estándar y generalmente no están integradas a (o sujetas a la disciplina de) la burocracia central del partido. La evidencia empírica se sustenta en dos casos de estudio: el Partido Justicialista y el Partido Roldosista Ecuatoriano, a modo de ejemplo de cómo funcionan los partidos informales de masas. /// This work highlights the importance of informal organization in the functioning of political parties in Latin America. Many Latin American parties operate primarily through unwritten rules and procedures, personal networks, and other informal mechanisms that lie outside their formal or bureaucratic structure. The universe of Latin American parties is not uniform, and parties differ considerably in terms of their type of organization and level of institutionalization. This article highlights the characteristics of a new party type, the informal mass party, which maintains a powerful base organization, extensive to the working and lower classes, and a large membership, while at the same time, its subunits are self-organized, lack a standard organizational form and generally are not integrated into (or subject to the discipline of) the central party bureaucracy. Empirical evidence is drawn from two case studies, the Argentine Justicialista Party and the Ecuadorian Roldosista Party, as a means of showing how informal mass parties function.},

However, data limitations inhibit our understanding of the extent of damage arising from freshwater pollution. We employ a novel hydrological approach combined with village census data to study the effect of upstream polluting behavior on downstream health in Indonesia. We find that upstream use of rivers for bathing and associated sanitary practices can explain as many as 7.5\% of all diarrhea-related deaths annually. We also find suggestive evidence for differential avoidance behavior in response to different pollutants. Our approach relies on publicly available satellite data, open source hydrological models, and coarse village census data allowing us to estimate health externalities from river pollution in particularly vulnerable and data poor environments.},
