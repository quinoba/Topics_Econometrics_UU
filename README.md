# Topics_Econometrics_UU
Replication paper for the Topics in Econometrics Course at Uppsala University.

This repository contains a comment on Greenstone, Michael, and Rema Hanna. 2014. "Environmental Regulations, Air and Water Pollution, and Infant Mortality in India." American Economic Review, 104 (10): 3038-72.

This was the final assignment for Adrian Adermon and Daniel Knutsson'  Topics in Econometrics Course.

This repository is divided in 2 main folders:

 1. GH_replication: which contains the original water dataset used by GH obtained from the replication package.
 
2. JB_replication: which contains my own replication package to replicate barrutia_1.pdf file

  - Inside JB_replication you will find barrutia.Rmd file which contains all the code I used. By knitring that document you should be able to obtain exactly the final version of barrutia_1.pdf
  
  - Make sure you have set your working directory to the source file location.
  
  - the JB_replication folder has three main subfolders:
          - code: which contains some code to India's river map
          - data: which has some data I use in the Rmd file
          - miscallanea: which contains some files that are necessary to replicate the my pdf file and also my bibliography.
